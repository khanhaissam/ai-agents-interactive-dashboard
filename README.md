# 🤖 AI Agents Interactive Dashboard

A visual and interactive dashboard based on the **Google AI “Agents” whitepaper**, designed to teach, explore, and prototype AI agent architectures — complete with real-time Gemini AI assistance and starter LangChain code generation.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 📐 Visualizes core components of an AI agent (model, tools, orchestration)
- 💡 Explains each with plain English, plus optional Gemini-generated analogies
- 🔍 Deep dives into tool types: Extensions, Functions, and Data Stores
- 🎯 Lets users design their own agent architecture from a business problem
- 🧑‍💻 Generates LangChain-based starter code for the proposed agent

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Gemini API for explanation, analogy, use-case, and code generation
- Inspired by: [Google DeepMind Agents Whitepaper (2023)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/google-deepmind-agents.pdf)
